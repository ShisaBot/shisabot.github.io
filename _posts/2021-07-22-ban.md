`Syntax: shisa ban <user> [days] [reason]`

`days` is the amount of days of messages to cleanup on ban.

## Examples:

```
shisa ban 428675506947227648 7 Continued to spam after told to stop.
```

This will ban Twentysix and it will delete 7 days worth of messages.

```
shisa ban @Twentysix 7 Continued to spam after told to stop.
```

This will ban Twentysix and it will delete 7 days worth of messages.

A user ID should be provided if the user is not a member of this server.

If days is not a number, it's treated as the first word of the reason.

Minimum 0 days, maximum 7. If not specified, the defaultdays setting will be used instead.
